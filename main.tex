  \section*{Overview}
  In a university building, it is often very difficult for students to predict 
  whether a certain room or a table will be available to sit and study in, and
  often the best bet that students have is randomly guessing and checking a 
  location that might have free seats. This problem can be generalized to having 
  free benches in the gym, or study rooms being free in the library. 

  We propose using the crowdsourcing model that has been successful in areas 
  such as determining bus occupancy for making an algorithm for alpha availability. 
  We defiine alpha availability as the general problem of determining whether 
  a resource would be available at a given time given that users have 
  provided information about when the resource had been last used.
